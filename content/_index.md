        I'm a data scientist and researcher. My toolkit combines data science, program evaluation, and economics to analyze societal outcomes in the higher education, workforce, and science policy fields.

        At Mathematica, I routinely work with clients such as the National Science Foundation, to better understand and leverage their data for rigorous decision making. I combine rigorous causal inference methodologies and advanced machine learning techniques with qualitative work to extract meaningful patterns from administrative data and unstructured text.
